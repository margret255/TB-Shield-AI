# TB Shield â€“ AI Unit 

This project was developed for the **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** unit.  
The goal is to demonstrate the use of AI for **early TB screening and awareness** through a web interface.

## Project Overview
TB Shield is a web application designed to:
- Provide **educational resources** about Tuberculosis (TB)
- Use a **simple AI prediction tool** to screen users based on symptoms and risk factors
- Support community engagement through awareness initiatives

## Key AI Features
- **AI Screening Tool**: A form-based tool collecting user input to predict TB risk (demo with logistic regression rules; can be replaced with real model API)
- **Dynamic Risk Display**: Shows risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on input features
- **Backend Integration**: Designed to integrate a trained AI model via API for real predictions

## Other Features
- Responsive **HTML/CSS layout**
- Interactive **JavaScript forms** and result handling
- Awareness sections highlighting vision, mission, and goals
- Call-to-action sections for community engagement

## Technologies Used
- **Python (backend for AI model / future integration)**
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+ (form handling, dynamic results, smooth scrolling)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to explore the frontend
3. Use the AI Screening Tool to demo risk predictions (currently placeholder logic)

> Note: Replace frontend placeholder with backend AI integration to get real predictions.
